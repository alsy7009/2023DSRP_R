This dataset contains patient data for patients screened for breast cancer. Data contains various biomarkers, if the patient was diagnosed with breast cancer, and recurrence-free survival time.
The purpose of creating this repository is to learn data science skills using R and learn how to use GitHub.
An interesting finding was that tumor size and tumor grade have no significant effect on the recurrence-free survival time of the patient. In this dataset, age and menopause have the most correlation.
